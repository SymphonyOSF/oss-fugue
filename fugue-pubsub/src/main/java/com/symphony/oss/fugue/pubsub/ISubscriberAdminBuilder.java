   * This method allows for the deletion of subscriptions which are no longer required. It causes the subscription
   * to be deleted during both deploy and undeploy operations. If currently running instances of the service are
   * actively consuming from this subscription then they will experience errors. For this reason, subscriptions
   * should normally be phased out in two stages (assuming a no downtime deployment is required). In the first
   * stage the service would remove the withSubscription() call, once that version is deployed a subsequent
   * deployment can be made including a call to this method, which will cause the subscription to be deleted.
   * 
   * This does mean that messages will back up on the subscription during the period between the two releases
   * which may cause montioring systems to alert.
