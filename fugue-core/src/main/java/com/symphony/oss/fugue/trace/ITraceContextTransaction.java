package com.symphony.oss.fugue.trace;

import java.io.Closeable;

/**
 * A Trace context against which events, or operations can be logged to gain a picture of the end to end business process of
 * a subject object across potentially multiple services.
 * 
 * The default implementation emits pubsub messages for each context and each event although other implementations
 * are possible.
 * 
 * This class implements Closable and it is recommended that it should be created in a try-with-resources block.
 * 
 * The close method implies aborted() unless aborted() or finished() has been called, so it is important to call
 * finished() as the last statement in the try-with-resource block.
 * 
 * Typical usage is:
 * <code>
    ITraceContextTransactionFactory factory;
    String                          subjectId;
    
    try(ITraceContextTransaction traceTransaction = factory.createTransaction("Subject Type", subjectId))
    {
      ITraceContext trace = traceTransaction.open()
      // Business logic here
      trace("SOME_EVENT")
      // More business logic, maybe multiple calls to trace

      traceTransaction.finished(); // if an exception id thrown before here then the close will abort the transaction.
    }
 * </code>
 * 
 * Calling the open() method on this class returns an ITraceContext on which events may be logged. This ITraceContext
 * should be passed to other methods rather than passing this class directly. This avoids the possibility that called code 
 * closes the ITraceContextTransaction by mistake.
